In this situation we recommend you try these two options: 1) use one of the candidateDuplicateVenues included in the response of the 409 error, or 2) ignore duplicates and force the addition of a new venue by resubmitting the same venue add request with two additional parameters: ignoreDuplicates set to true and ignoreDuplicatesKey set to the value from the earlier error response. In addition to this, give users the ability to say \"never mind, check-in here anyway\" and perform a manual (\"venueless\") checkin by specifying just the venue name. All fields are optional, but one of either a valid address or a geolat/geolong pair must be provided. We recommend that developers provide a geolat/geolong pair in every case.
