Setting the numCategories parameter to 100 will not change this behavior, as numCategories is overruled by relevance thresholds.\n                                                        If you would like to see all matching categories (sorted alphabetically), regardless of relevance thresholds, use the showAllMatchingCategories parameter.

If, on the other hand, your keyword search has skipped to a single category, and you would simply like to see results from more than that one category (still subject to relevance thresholds), use the doSkipping parameter instead."
