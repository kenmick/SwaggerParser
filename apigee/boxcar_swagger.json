Please note, this API call is an exception and will return an HTTP status code of 404 if we are unable to find the registered user by e-mail in our system. If the email address is not found in our system, we'll send an email to it letting the user know where they can download Boxcar. If the user has already added your service, we'll return an HTTP status code of 401.",
